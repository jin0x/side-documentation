The description of the member is shown inside the modal of each individual member in headshots block
DRE and Position are both shown inside the member card and inside the modal
Phone number and email are only shown at the headshot modal

Show contact button and show schedule button is used to control on whether any of those options is visible at the agent details bar which is used on several pages like pocket listings details page.
Due to the fact that there are some cases where we don't have access to these options but only inside the code of the project, providing these options on a team member level is the best way to let the editor control these options. 
Please note that these two options are only shown inside the agent details bar and not in the headshots block.
